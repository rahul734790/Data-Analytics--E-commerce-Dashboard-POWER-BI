1. Promote high-profit categories (e.g., Printers) via campaigns.
2. Investigate Q2 losses (especially May, June) for operational or marketing issues.
3. Encourage prepaid options by offering discounts to reduce COD reliance.
4. Retarget top customers (like Jayant) for loyalty programs.
5. Upsell clothing buyers with accessories to boost profits.
